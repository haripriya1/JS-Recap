    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals – Part 1</h1>
    <h3>Javascript versions : ES6(2015) ------------------------------------------- ES25
      ES - ECMA Script
      
      
      Primitive Data Type:
      Number = floating number that need not have a number after a decimal point like 23 is considered 23.0 and 23.5 is also a number. Number can be either a decimal or a interger
      String = Seq of charac is string, always needs to be between a '' or "" to not let considered a keyword
      Boolean = true or false is used to take decisions
      undefined = is declared but is not set with a value ex: let childred;
      Null = considered a empty value
      Symbol = intro in ES2015 that a value is unique and cannot be changed
      BigInt = intro in ES2020 used whe n larger integers are used which number type cannot hol   d
      
     
     Undefined : This gives that year is undefined as no value is assigned to it
     let year;
     console.log(year);
     console.log(typeof year);
     
     If we take null and ask for its type its is gives as object because of the bug and its not chnaged due to its legacy terms
     
     let keyword can be used in the script for a value that can or need not change its vslue later
     let age =30;
     age =31;

     whereas for a const cannot be chnaged 
     const birthYear = 1995;
     birthYear = 1990; (here we get the error assignment to constant)

     const where used a value must be decalred for it
     const hi; (This gives error that missing declaration)

     Its best practise to use const unless its sure that value changes, it is also better necause changing variable intro potential bugs in code.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

var is used to declare varibale untill 2015

var job ="programmer";
job = 'teacher'; (this doesnt give any results as its acceptabble)


    its not necessary to declare a variable, even if not it still works but its terrible idea as JS will create the varibale in global object in this case but not in current scope
     lastName = "Gundala";
     constant.log(lastName); (This still displays Gundala in console)


  Operators:

  Mathematical Operators : + - / *
  const ageHaripriya = 2023 - 1995;
  const ageDinesh = 2025-1995;
  constant.log(ageHaripriya, ageDinesh);

  Now + can be used in Mathematical or adding strings as well
   const  firstName = "Haripriya";
   const secondName ="Gundala";
   console.log(firstName + ' ' lastName);
